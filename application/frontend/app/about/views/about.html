            <h3>About VelociRX</h3>
            <p>VelociRCX is designed to help consumers learn more about the the side effects and potentially harmful interactions
            that can occur when taking prescription and over the counter medications. The United Stated Food and Drug Administration tracks
            adverse reactions and recalls that are reported for drugs, both at the generic and brand specific level. This data is available
            to the public, and VelociRX helps users examine that data in an easy-to-use way.</p>
            <h3>Food and Drug Administration</h3>
            <p>VelociRX leverages the openFDA project, which makes the FDA's database of adverse drug reactions and drug recalls open
            and available to the public. When a VelociRX user performs a search, that search is done directly against the FDA's latest registry,
            so the data is always up to date.</p>
            <p>How does VelociRX determine which drugs to show for a given condition? The VelociRX team has compiled a list of synonyms for common medical
            conditions and keep a list in the VelociRX database. When a user enters a condition, such as "high blood pressure", in the site the
            system checks to see if there are medical synonyms registered for this condition. In the "high blood pressure" example, VelociRX
            actually searches for "high blood pressure", "hypertension", "HBP", or "HBT" when checking with FDA. This allows to truly capture all events and
            recalls for a condition, despite whether they are registered by a consumer using layman terms or a physician using medical terms. The medical synonyms
            for this feature were pulled from the <a href="http://voxhealth.org/">voxhealth.org</a></p>

            <h3>National Institute of Health</h3>
            <p>VelociRX leverages National Library of Medicine's drug interactions API to retrieve known drug interactions between two types of drugs.
            This data is made available to the public via the RXNav API.</p>
