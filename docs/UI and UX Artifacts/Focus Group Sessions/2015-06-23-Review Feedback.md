Purpose of Meeting: The purpose of the meeting was to demo the progress achieved so far on the F18 prototype. Bob explained that the FDA was looking for partners to help them create application for users to be able to mine the massive amount of data they have with the new OPEN FDA.  The approach FDA has taken to reach out for potential contracts is to have interested parties construct and deliver a prototype against the OPEN FDA data set in a 2 week timeframe. Key selling points for the product we are creating include:
·        Our application is being developed to Browse by Condition instead of searching by drug name. Users would type a condition and the system would return potential drugs that would help their condition.
·        We are trying to find a way to have the system respond automatically to both technical terms and layman terms when searching. This we believe provides one of the most value added feature we could provide at this time.
 
 
Comments on meeting:
1.      The potential issue of having users self-prescribe because of this site needs to be carefully considered. We informed that both the FDA and our site would include disclaimers.
2.      Need to potentially look into the contrast – look and feel. When projecting it was hard to see in presentation.
a.      Be careful of text contrast on white
3.      Users inquired about spelling autocomplete and spell check.
4.      Need to make sure the app can handle technical terms as well as layman terms when searching.
a.      Looking for auto ways to leverage existing APIs or web site scrapping to get to this data..
5.      Need to stay away from stating or using words like SAFE as we would need to justify or clearly explain what is meant by this. Instead use “most frequently reported”.  In our case we are just counting the most often used. We will include a summarization stating how we came up with these results.
a.      We can also include disclaimers.  Not to many or it will potentially render site as not reliable.
6.      We also need to define what we mean when our search results state physician recommended ? Our definition is that most physicians recommended it. At this time, this is just a count. We will make sure we publish or clearly explain our heuristics.
7.      Also instead of stating most, best, for results page graph use terms such as:  is in the top quartile, top one third, etc…
8.      Need context for data results. E.g., how many bottles of Tylenol where sold last year.
9.      Phase 2 Suggestions: Vision needs to be described in document – as a roadmap.
1.      Include Future road map under ABOUT – in Future Phases section.
2.      Add ability to view site in Spanish during next phase
3.      Add button to switch mockup into Spanish.
4.      Add ability to view picture of pills.
5.      Want to see price information – E.g., 30 day supply price
6.      Ability to execute a side by side comparison of selected drugs.
 
10.   For results graph add quadrants and make sure the most favorable result is different or easily visible.
11.   Audience confirmed that they believe the public would consider the FDA as a trust worthy site.
12.   Vicodin and Percocet are incorrectly showing  under acetaminophen
13.   Which has the most adverse events and what where these.
14.   Shyam stated that our main objective at this time should be to make sure we pass with flying colors on Agile part.
