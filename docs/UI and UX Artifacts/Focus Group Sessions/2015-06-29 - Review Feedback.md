### Review Session
Monday, June 29, 2015

### Attendees:
Jennifer J., Shyam S, Indunil R, Dawn P, Michael K, Victorino V, Paul A, Michael R, Jeff M, Bob W, Kapil G, Michael I, Amit Y, John D, Denny C.


**Purpose of Meeting**: The purpose of the meeting was to demo the progress achieved so far on the F18 prototype. Bob reviewed the Landing Page that includes as its main functionality a Search by Symptoms with an auto complete feature. He clarified that the application currently does not support searching by drug name via this landing page search. As part of the current functionality the application collects synonyms based on the search results. This is considered a “Must Have” feature that would help users not have to enter many additional details they may not have. At this time the application was also lacking a Browse Drugs Search. However based on feedback from audience this will be made a top priority to include. 

###Suggestions/Comments/To do:

**Landing Page:**
* Move search to a more prominent place on the screen (maybe middle) as this is the primary purpose of screen.
* The landing page needs to be clear as to purpose.
* Jeff M. suggested maybe displaying results under three categories such as: SAFE>EFFECTIVE>ECONOMICAL. 
* The name will also need to be revisited. Manna did not strike a cord with the audience.
* Need to add a progress indicator, spinning dial or anything to that effect to inform users that the system is working on retrieving their results.

**Adverse Event results:**
* When selecting to change a filter for displayed adverse event results, the total number of adverse event results on title line should adjust. 
* Out of Total Adverse Events – show totals for your selection only.
* Need to look into adding BUTTON that would provide information with regards to what this page is displaying - Adverse ### ### Events not test results.
* Need to be able to distinguish substance results as generic or brand names
* Agreed that finding denominator is an issue – we do not know where to look
* Informative text needs to be added to assist users with definitions for complex words. Maybe clicking on a word could take them to a definition.
* Suggested to post under ABOUT a video or pictures that would provide a walkthrough of the application.
* Will continue to brainstorm the best order (sorting) to display adverse events.
